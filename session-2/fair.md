## Part 1: FAIR Principles in Earth Observation Context
*Duration: 15 minutes (11:05-11:20)*

### What is FAIR?

FAIR principles ensure that Earth Observation data and research outputs are:

````{grid} 2 2 2 2
:gutter: 3

```{grid-item-card} **Findable**
The first step in (re)using data is to find them
- **F1**: (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- **F2**: data are described with rich metadata
- **F3**: metadata clearly include the identifier of the data they describe  
- **F4**: (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource
```

```{grid-item-card} **Accessible**
Users need to know how data can be accessed, including authentication
- **A1**: (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised protocol
- **A1.1**: the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
- **A1.2**: the protocol allows for authentication and authorisation where necessary
- **A2**: metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
```

```{grid-item-card} **Interoperable**
Data need to integrate with other data and interoperate with applications
- **I1**: (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language
- **I2**: (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- **I3**: (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data
```

```{grid-item-card} **Reusable**
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data
- **R1**: (meta)data are richly described with accurate and relevant attributes
- **R1.1**: (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
- **R1.2**: (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
- **R1.3**: (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards
```
````

### Why FAIR Matters for Earth Observation

**Machine-Actionability**: The GO FAIR Foundation emphasizes that FAIR implementations should ensure machine-actionability. In EO, this means satellites, processing systems, and analysis tools can automatically discover, access, and use data without human intervention.

**Global Participation**: EO is inherently global - Earth system science requires data from multiple countries and institutions. FAIR principles enable worldwide collaboration and data sharing.

**Interoperability**: EO data comes from diverse sensors and processing systems. FAIR principles ensure these different data sources can work together effectively.

**Long-term Stewardship**: Many EO datasets represent decades of observations. FAIR principles ensure these valuable time series remain accessible and usable for future research.

### FAIR vs. Open

```{admonition} Important Distinction
:class: note
**FAIR â‰  Open**: Data can be FAIR without being fully open. The key is that access conditions are clear and standardized, even for restricted data.
```

Examples in EO:
- **Open**: Landsat and Sentinel data freely available to all users
- **FAIR but Restricted**: Commercial satellite data with clear licensing and access procedures
- **FAIR but Embargoed**: Research datasets with time-limited access restrictions

**Short-term Goals (1-3 Months):**
- Develop implementation roadmap
- Secure necessary resources and approvals
- Begin pilot projects with high-impact datasets
- Establish measurement and evaluation frameworks

**Long-term Objectives (6-12 Months):**
- Deploy core FAIR infrastructure
- Establish operational procedures and governance
- Demonstrate measurable benefits to stakeholders
- Contribute to community standards and best practices

### Connecting to the Week's Themes

**Foundation for AI (Wednesday):**
FAIR data principles create the reliable, accessible datasets that enable successful AI/ML applications in Earth Observation.

**Enabling Innovation (Thursday):**
Organizations with robust FAIR implementations can rapidly respond to new opportunities, create data-driven services, and build sustainable partnerships.

**Future Technologies (Friday):**
Emerging technologies like quantum computing and edge AI will require the standardized, interoperable data infrastructure that FAIR principles provide.
