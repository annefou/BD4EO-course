# Part 1: FAIR Principles in Earth Observation Context 

## What is FAIR?

FAIR principles ensure that Earth Observation data and research outputs are:

### **F**indable
*The first step in (re)using data is to find them*

- **F1**: (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- **F2**: data are described with rich metadata
- **F3**: metadata clearly include the identifier of the data they describe
- **F4**: (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

### **A**ccessible
*Users need to know how data can be accessed, including authentication*

- **A1**: (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised protocol
- **A1.1**: the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
- **A1.2**: the protocol allows for authentication and authorisation where necessary
- **A2**: metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

### **I**nteroperable
*Data need to integrate with other data and interoperate with applications*

- **I1**: (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language
- **I2**: (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- **I3**: (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

### **R**eusable
*The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data*

- **R1**: (meta)data are richly described with accurate and relevant attributes
- **R1.1**: (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
- **R1.2**: (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
- **R1.3**: (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

## Why FAIR Matters for Earth Observation

**Machine-Actionability**: Satellites, processing systems, and analysis tools can automatically discover, access, and use data without human intervention.

**Global Participation**: EO is inherently global - Earth system science requires data from multiple countries and institutions. FAIR principles enable worldwide collaboration.

**Interoperability**: EO data comes from diverse sensors and processing systems. FAIR principles ensure these different data sources work together effectively.

**Long-term Stewardship**: Many EO datasets represent decades of observations. FAIR principles ensure these valuable time series remain accessible and usable for future research.

## Important Distinction: FAIR â‰  Open

Data can be FAIR without being fully open. The key is that access conditions are clear and standardized.

**Examples in EO:**
- **Open**: Landsat and Sentinel data freely available to all users
- **FAIR but Restricted**: Commercial satellite data with clear licensing and access procedures
- **FAIR but Embargoed**: Research datasets with time-limited access restrictions
