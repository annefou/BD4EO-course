# BD4EO Course: EO Processing Workflows & FAIR Data

```{margin}
**Authors**: Anne Fouilloux  
**Affiliation**: Simula Research Laboratory  
**Course**: Big Data Foundations for Earth Observation  
**Location**: Riga  
**Sessions**: Tuesday, 09:10-10:30 & 11:00-12:00
```

Welcome to the course materials for understanding modern Earth Observation processing workflows and implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles in professional environments.

## Course Overview

This course bridges the gap between technical EO processing capabilities and strategic data management approaches, designed specifically for **lecturers, industry professionals, and government representatives** who need to understand and implement modern EO workflows in their organizations.

### What Makes This Course Different

Rather than focusing purely on technical implementation details, we emphasize:
- **Practical value** of modern EO processing approaches for real-world applications
- **Implementation strategies** for FAIR data principles across different organizational contexts
- **Organizational readiness** assessment and planning for sustainable data practices
- **Real-world examples** from ESA's operational services demonstrating successful FAIR implementation

## Key Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you will:

**Technical Understanding:**
- Recognize the evolution and benefits of cloud-native EO processing
- Understand the role of Python and modern data formats in EO workflows
- Appreciate the technical foundations that enable FAIR data practices

**FAIR Implementation Capabilities:**
- Assess your organization's current FAIR maturity across all four principles
- Design implementation strategies for making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable
- Create actionable plans with realistic timelines and resource requirements
- Connect with communities and standards that support FAIR implementation

**Professional Network:**
- Connect with ESA's operational services and expert communities
- Access ongoing support through platforms like EarthCODE and Pangeo
- Build relationships with peers facing similar data management challenges

## Interactive Learning Approach

This course combines multiple learning modalities:

**Live Demonstrations:** Real-world exploration of ESA's Cubes & Clouds {cite}`cubes_clouds_2024`, EOPF Sample Service {cite}`eopf_sample_service`, and EarthCODE {cite}`earthcode_2025` platforms

**FAIR Assessment Exercises:** Sector-specific group work on evaluating and improving data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability

**Hands-on Tools:** Interactive notebooks for organizational FAIR maturity assessment and implementation planning

**Community Engagement:** Direct connection to ongoing professional communities and support networks

## How to Use These Materials

This Jupyter Book contains everything you need for the two BD4EO sessions:

- **[Session 1](session1/overview.md)**: Complete materials for the EO processing workflows session, including live demo examples
- **[Session 2](session2/overview.md)**: Full content for FAIR data principles with interactive assessment tools
- **[Interactive Notebooks](session2/fair_notebook.ipynb)**: Self-assessment tools you can use to evaluate your organization's FAIR maturity
- **Supporting Resources**: Links to ESA services, community platforms, and continued learning opportunities

## ESA Context

This course showcases ESA's comprehensive approach to modern EO processing and FAIR data implementation through operational examples:

- **[Cubes & Clouds](https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds)**: Educational excellence in cloud-native EO processing {cite}`cubes_clouds_2024`
- **[EOPF Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/)**: Next-generation processing framework with Zarr optimization {cite}`eopf_sample_service`
- **[EarthCODE](https://earthcode.esa.int)**: Comprehensive FAIR implementation across the EO ecosystem {cite}`earthcode_2025`
- **[Copernicus Data Space](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/)**: Operational cloud platform for EO data access and processing {cite}`copernicus_data_space`
