## Course Overview

This course bridges the gap between technical EO processing capabilities and strategic data management approaches, designed specifically for **lecturers, industry professionals, and government representatives** who need to understand and implement modern EO workflows in their organizations.

## What Makes This Course Different

Rather than focusing purely on technical details, we emphasize:

* **Practical applications** showing how cloud-native EO processing solves real workflow challenges
* **FAIR principles awareness** applied specifically to Earth Observation contexts  
* **Operational examples** from ESA's platforms (EOPF, EarthCODE) demonstrating working implementations
* **Hands-on exploration** of modern tools and workflows you can continue using

## Key Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you will:
- Understand cloud-native EO processing and how it creates organizational value through improved efficiency and collaboration
- Experience modern Python tools and platforms through hands-on demonstrations relevant to your sector
- Assess your organization's current data management practices and identify improvement opportunities
- Design practical implementation strategies with realistic timelines and resource requirements
- Recognize how FAIR data principles can improve data utilization in your organizational context
- Evaluate technical solutions and platforms based on your specific operational needs
- Connect with expert communities and ongoing support resources for continued implementation
- Build professional relationships with peers facing similar data management challenges

## Interactive Learning Approach

This course combines multiple learning approaches:

- **Live Demonstrations:** Real-world exploration of ESA's EOPF Sample Service and EarthCODE platforms with hands-on Python examples
- **Interactive Discussions:** Group reflection on FAIR principles applied to Earth Observation contexts
- **Practical Examples:** Concrete EO workflow scenarios demonstrating cloud-native processing benefits
- **Resource Connections:** Introduction to ongoing professional communities and platforms for continued learning

## ESA Context

This course showcases ESA's comprehensive approach to modern EO processing and FAIR data implementation through operational examples:

- **[Cubes & Clouds](https://eo-college.org/courses/cubes-and-clouds)**: Educational excellence in cloud-native EO processing {cite}`cubes_clouds_2024`
- **[EOPF Sample Service](https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/)**: Next-generation processing framework with Zarr optimization {cite}`eopf_sample_service`
- **[EarthCODE](https://earthcode.esa.int)**: Comprehensive FAIR implementation across the EO ecosystem {cite}`earthcode_2025`
- **[Copernicus Data Space](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/)**: Operational cloud platform for EO data access and processing {cite}`copernicus_data_space`

## Prerequisites

**Essential:**
- General understanding of Earth Observation concepts and applications
- Familiarity with organizational data management challenges
- Interest in modernizing EO processing and data sharing approaches

**Helpful but not required:**
- Basic Python programming experience
- Knowledge of cloud computing concepts
